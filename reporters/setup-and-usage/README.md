# Becoming a Reporter

Telliot is the main CLI of the project.  It is a customizable python repository that can handle all functions of being a reporter in the Tellor system.&#x20;

Note: the easiest way to become a reporter is through Telliot. However, the tellor contracts do not require telliot usage. Tellor can be interacted with in any scripting language, and, in some cases, Etherscan.

## Set up and Usage

Follow the installation and setup instructions at: [https://tellor-io.github.io/telliot-feeds/getting-started/](https://tellor-io.github.io/telliot-feeds/getting-started/)
