# Introduction

There are two main functions of being a reporter on the tellor network:

* Staking (locking a bond that can be slashed if a bad value is reported)
* Reporting (submitting data on-chain)

Additionally, it is recommended that reporters monitor for disputes and partake in the Tellor community, voting on proposals and disputed data. &#x20;
