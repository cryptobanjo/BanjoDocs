# Introduction

There are two main functions of being a reporter for the Tellor protocol:

* Staking (locking a bond that can be slashed if a bad value is reported)
* Reporting (submitting data on-chain)

Additionally, it is recommended that reporters monitor data submissions, partake in the Tellor community, and [vote on disputed data.](https://app.gitbook.com/s/tcQlo49FAqTaOimNOz0X/disputing-data)
