# Overview

Telliot is a Python framework for interacting with the decentralized TellorX network. With Telliot, you (or your smart contract) can:

* Ask the TellorX Decentralized Oracle to answer a question (we call that _tipping_)
* Submit answers to questions that other people (or smart contracts) ask. (we call that _reporting_. Reporters earn tips, but must stake TRB as collateral against incorrect answers)
* Look up historical answers.
* Help maintain the security of the TellorX network by disputing inaccurate answers and voting on other disputes.
