## Guides and Tutorials

We believe good documentation should provide everything you need to get up and running with Tellor.  But, for those of you who need a little extra guidance and like tutorials, this is the place for you.  And who doesn't like a good tutorial?

{% hint style="info" %}
The two places where we publish tutorials are the **Guide section of our blog** and a playlist of youtube content we call **Tellor School**.&#x20;

\*Note, these will continue to be updated with new content.
